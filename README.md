#some C++ samples

These are mostly samples of some of the C++ code I have written. Just so readers aren't too confused by the length and complexity of the codes, I have tried to select code samples that are relatively short but are still representative of my coding style and abilities. 

There are total five folders, each independent of one another. Header files with class declaration/definitions as well as the main implementation files are included within the folders. 

I also included a shell script (in its entirety) that I have used to run a hardware engineering design automation flow for my research. It should be demonstrative of the kind of scripting I have had to do using shell-scripts+awk.
